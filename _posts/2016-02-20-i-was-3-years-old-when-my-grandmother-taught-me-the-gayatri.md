description: "I was 3 years old when my grandmother taught me the Gayatri Mantra. One of my earliest memories are of reciting it to her and her friends at the Arya Samaj and being rewarded with 1 rupee! When I was a few years older she introduced me to the concept of meditation, though not in so many words. What she actually asked me to do was to recite the mantra 108 times every night before bed with my eyes closed and my focus on my third eye. Doing so, she said, would open up my third eye. I was too young to know what she meant but would always feel tingling there when I did as she said, which candidly wasn't often. As I have grown older I have come closer to understanding what she meant. Unlocking the third eye chakra has held a special meaning for me. Beyond the third eye I have come to appreciate the role unlocking each one of our 7 energy chakras plays in our overall well-being and personal growth. It made sense then that when I decided to get tattooed I picked the 7 energy chakras. In collaboration with my tattoo artist we decided to coil them around my left arm sleeve. We started in late 2014. The tattoo is now finally complete and I am excited to share first photos of the completed sleeve. Tattoo credit: Cats McDaid-Kelly Photo credit: Jane Hu"
